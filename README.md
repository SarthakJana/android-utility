## Introduction
Android Utility is a collection of various small utility libraries which are used in almost every Android project.
Instead of creating a large bunch, we have created different small libraries for the different purpose i.e. for shared preference, validation, custom views etc.

**The aim of this utility library are;**
* Provide utility libraries to make the development easy
* Prevent writing the same piece of code multiple times
* Contribution on the utility field from all over the world

Android Utlity SDK is available from SDK version 22.

## Get Started

This guide is a quick start to add SmilePass biometric verification to an Android app. Android Studio is the recommended development environment for building an app with the SmilePass SDK.


## Prerequisites

### Minimum SDK
Your application needs to support minimum SDK version 22.


## Add Utility to your app

Add a specific utlity library which you need to use in your app. To do this, add the following dependency in your app level `build.gradle` file-
```gradle
implementation 'com.otb.utility:{module-name}:{latest-version}'
```

If you want to use `preference` library, you can  use following dependency-
```gradle
implementation 'com.otb.utility:preference:0.0.1'
```

The latest version can be found at the top of this file.
The library is indexed on Bintray JCenter repository with all versions [here](https://bintray.com/ourtechnobytes-5/maven).


You are all set to use cutting-edge face verification features of the SmilePass.
